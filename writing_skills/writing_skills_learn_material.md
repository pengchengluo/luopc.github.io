### 实现原型系统
* To study the efficiency of our algorithm, which we name Window Variation Keyword Burst Detection, we implement a ***proof-of-concept system***.


### 连词
* The main result confirms what we previously noted [22,23], that is, ***in spite of*** a growing trend of ORD publication, most of them are **scarcely** used, ***albeit*** with some differences between the disciplinary fields.


### 总结
* ***All in all***, a concentration of usage over few datasets was observed, in an unbalanced situation where most ORD are never consulted once published.

### 填补空白
* We aim to **bridge the gap** described above that separates information retrieval research from the practice of building real-world search applications.

### de facto: 事实上的
* Solr and Elasticsearch (for convenience, we simply refer to as “Lucene” collectively in this paper) have become the **de facto** platform for deploying search applications in industry
### take a back seat: 处于次要地位
* In many cases, scalability **took a back seat** to efforts around improving retrieval models, and thus these systems often struggle to scale to modern web collection.
### lag behind: 落后
* Another side effect of Lucene’s focus on “black box” search is that it has severely **lagged behind** in the implementation of modern ranking functions.
### be capable of: 能够承担 ； with ease：轻易地
It is capable of handling large web collections on a single server with ease.
